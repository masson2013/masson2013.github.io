#Awesome
It seems like yesterday, however, it has been three years when I first try GitHub Page. I failed last time and it was always 404 error. I cannot fix it and I have no idear how long I have played with it.
I have spent 2 hours today, I figured out the index.html issue, which is releated gh-page branch issue. Also, I have setup this blog successfully. It is pretty cool.
Finally, I can put some tech though here by using MarkDown.
